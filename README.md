# Tetris Remake in C++
Project Description
Welcome to the Tetris Remake project! This is a classic video game reimagined and recreated using C++ and the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) library. This README provides a glimpse into the journey of bringing this timeless puzzle game to life and offers insights into the project's structure and how to get started.

The Story Behind the Creation
In the summer of 2024, a dedicated group of programmers set out on a quest to revive one of the most iconic video games ever created: Tetris. The goal was to capture the essence of the original while exploring modern C++ programming techniques and leveraging the powerful SFML library for graphical rendering and user input handling.

The team embarked on a coding adventure, driven by a shared passion for both classic games and coding challenges. The initial steps involved researching the core mechanics of Tetris, including the game’s logic for falling blocks, line clearing, and scoring. With a clear vision in mind, they began crafting the game’s architecture, starting with the foundational elements of piece generation, movement, and collision detection.

As the development progressed, the team integrated SFML to handle the graphical aspects of the game. SFML provided a straightforward yet robust framework for rendering the game’s visuals, managing user input, and creating a seamless gameplay experience. The choice of SFML was driven by its ease of use and the ability to quickly prototype and iterate on game features.

The journey was not without its challenges. The team faced numerous hurdles, from debugging complex collision algorithms to fine-tuning the game’s responsiveness. However, the satisfaction of seeing the game come to life, piece by piece, was a reward that kept them motivated.

In the end, their hard work culminated in a game that pays homage to the original Tetris while showcasing their skills and creativity. This Tetris Remake is a testament to the timeless appeal of classic games and the joy of programming.
